Homework 4
==========

The starter code for this homework assignment is split across several
Coq source files.

To get started, first build the starter code using the supplied
`Makefile`:

> make

Then open up `HW4.v` in your favorite Coq IDE (ProofGeneral, VSCode,
etc.) and follow the instructions.

Note that you'll need to skim the `Map.v` file and will need to read
the `Lang.v` file in detail. Also, the `Hints.v` file contains several
hints if you are having trouble making progress on the assignment.

Good luck!
